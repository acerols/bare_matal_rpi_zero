USB Keyboard keycode reading example for RPi Zero W.

USB driver is derived from https://github.com/Chadderz121/csud .

Only basic USB keyboards can be used. Any additional functions
including wireless connection, multimedia keys, pointing devices
may cause USB driver errors.

You can use a USB hub to connect a keyboard. Multiple keyboards
can be connected but this program scans key codes from only one
keyboard.
