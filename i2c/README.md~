# mini-uart

Mini-UART character output and echo back example for RPi Zero W.

With RPi Zero W we have to use mini-UART because UART0, which is available on other RPis, is used for the on-board bluetooth.

Connect GPIO14(Tx), GPIO15(Rx), GND to your UART adapter Rx, Tx, GND.
GPIO14 is Pin 8 and GPIO15 is Pin10.
While there are several GND pins, Pin6 is recommended since it is easy to find.
